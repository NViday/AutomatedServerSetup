#Automated Server Setup 

This is automating all the steps in Chidi from smashing magazine's tutorial about setting up a server with express. 

The automation stops at the CD/CI section, because part of that section needs to be done manually. 

Some informations are different than the tutorial because they are my preferences and I will encourage everybody to change them as they would like. 

Please review the files in the serverFiles (folder)  and the tutorial and change them as you'd like. 

The folder fullpath  for this script needs to be sepecified for it to work.For that, you have 2 options:

1) Insert as the third input when calling the function 
2) Hard-Code it in the script [RECOMMENDED]
